# Website Injector Scripts and Styles

This is a collection of scripts and styles I use with a browser injector plugin.

### Amazon

Adds a keyboard shortcut to focus the search bar when the slash "/" key is pressed.

### YouTube

This adds a link to the embedded version of videos, so they are watchable in full window mode (not full screen). The link text is a âŠ• symbol near the title.

### Vimeo

Add playback speed hotkeys to match YouTube's keys.

* `<` slow down playback by 25%.
* `>` speed up playback by 25%.

### Kickstarter

I hate sticky navs with a passion. Remove the sticky nav!

### Utah Special Plates

This adds links to the full size images of the Utah special group licence plates from this page: [http://dmv.utah.gov/plates/special-group](http://dmv.utah.gov/plates/special-group)
